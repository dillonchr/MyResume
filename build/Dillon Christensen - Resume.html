<p>I have a passion for creating things that can teach me something new and help people out. The desire to build things is what got me started when I was younger and my creative thinking and problem-solving skills are what have kept me moving forward. I love learning new things and finding new ways to use old tools. My objective is to continue growing and honing my skills to build better products.</p>

<ul>
<li>Created wireframes and medium fidelity mockups for new app</li>

</ul>
<p>So far, the product I started working on was with <strong>Angular 2</strong> in <strong>TypeScript</strong>. We found some deep-seated performance issues and tried switching to <strong>React</strong>. From there we added a <strong>WebGL</strong>-enhanced module to take the performance to a new high. The latest product was a mobile app built with <strong>React Native</strong> for internal users to survey sites across the world.</p>

<ul>
<li>Led full-stack development on customer-facing site</li>
<li>Learned and practiced <strong>SCRUM/Agile</strong> methodologies</li>

</ul>
<p>With a Python Django backend using <strong>Jinja2</strong> templates for markup, my development contributions were focused on frontend <strong>JS/CSS</strong> with some lightweight <strong>Jinja</strong> work. I worked in <strong>Sass</strong> and legacy Stylus, <strong>vanilla JS</strong> compiled with <strong>gulp</strong> using <strong>Webpack</strong> and <strong>ES6</strong> transpilation. We used <strong>jasmine</strong> in <strong>karma</strong> unit-tests and <strong>Istanbul</strong> for coverage. Every Pull Request ran through <strong>Circle CI</strong> with strict test coverage requirements.</p>

<li>Built responsive interactive content modules for high traffic clients</li>
<li>Architected fantasy sports web-app in <strong>AngularJS</strong></li>
<li>Contracted and managed development on overflow projects to meet tight deadlines</li>
</ul>
<p>The environment changed between clients. Most of the work I did here was PR&#39;d to the client&#39;s <strong>GitHub</strong> and published on their site by themselves. Vanilla <strong>JS/CSS/HTML</strong> content was the most common, with the one <strong>AngularJS</strong> app, and modifications to <strong>Wordpress</strong> and <strong>Squarespace</strong> themes peppered in here and there.</p>
