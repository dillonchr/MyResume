## Summary
I have a passion for creating things that can teach me something new and help people out. The desire to build things is what got me started when I was younger and my creative thinking and problem-solving skills are what have kept me moving forward. I love learning new things and finding new ways to use old tools. My objective is to continue growing and honing my skills to build better products.

## Professional Experience

So far, the product I started working on was in Angular 2 with TypeScript. We found some deep-seated performance issues and tried switching to React. From there we added a WebGL-enhanced module to take the performance to a new high. The latest product was a mobile app built with React Native for internal users to survey sites across the world.

## Technical Expertise
__Javascript__ has been a constant in my development roles. I've learned a lot of general techniques like unit testing, end-to-end testing, tooling, package managers, functional programming, MVC, MVVM. I love working with JS and keep looking for new areas to explore.

__HTML/CSS__ has been another core piece of my experience. I've worked with css preprocessors, accessibility requirements, and of course responsive design. 

__Process__ I think this has been an important aspect to development roles. The processes that I've worked in have made all the difference between companies. I'm a big SCRUM/Agile fan and feel like I can be most productive with the checks and balances it provides.
