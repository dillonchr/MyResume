I have a passion for creating things that can teach me something new and help people out. The desire to build things is what got me started when I was younger and my creative thinking and problem-solving skills are what have kept me moving forward. I love learning new things and finding new ways to use old tools. My objective is to continue growing and honing my skills to build better products.

#### Senior UX Developer
_February 2017 - Present_

* Delivered wireframes and low-mid fidelity mockups
* Developed frontend screens and features
* Debugged memory and performance issues

So far, the product I started working on was with __Angular 2__ in __TypeScript__. We ran into many performance issues with Angular and decided to switch to __React__. From there we added a __WebGL__-enhanced module to take the performance to a new high. The latest product was a mobile app built with __React Native__ for internal users to survey sites across the world.

### [ConsumerAffairs](https://consumeraffairs.com/) - Tulsa, OK
#### Software Engineer - Team Lead
_May 2016 - February 2017_

* Led full-stack development on customer-facing site
* Learned and practiced __SCRUM/Agile__ methodologies
* Close focus on performance and SEO

With a Python Django backend using __Jinja2__ templates for markup, my development contributions were focused on frontend __JS/CSS__ with some lightweight __Jinja__ work. I worked in __Sass__ and legacy Stylus, __vanilla JS__ compiled with __gulp__ using __Webpack__ and __ES6__ transpilation. We used __jasmine__ in __karma__ unit-tests and __Istanbul__ for coverage. Every Pull Request ran through __Circle CI__ with strict test coverage requirements.

_January 2016 - May 2016_

* Built responsive interactive content modules for high traffic clients
* Architected fantasy sports web-app in __AngularJS__
* Contracted and managed development on overflow projects to meet tight deadlines

The environment changed between clients. Most of the work I did here was PR'd to the client's __GitHub__ and published on their site by themselves. Vanilla __JS/CSS/HTML__ content was the most common, with the one __AngularJS__ app, and modifications to __Wordpress__ and __Squarespace__ themes peppered in here and there.
