**Hello, here's my story:** I love what I do. I love learning.  Figuring out how things work has been an passion for me since I was young, that same passion got me into development in the first place. Now with my career's focus, it opens endless possibilities that I can cherry pick as they inspire me. I want to find a place that feels the same way I do about development. I don't want to brag about myself, and I believe that open and honest communication is the best policy. So everything that follows lays out what I'm comfortable with diving into headfirst. Anything not listed, I'm excited to try.



### [Kalibrate](http://www.kalibrate.com/) - Tulsa, OK
#### Senior UX Developer
_February 2017 - June 2019_

* Developed frontend SaaS apps
* Debugged memory and performance issues
* Drew up wireframes and low-to-mid fidelity mockups

Most recently I've been working on rewriting the main offering of Kalibrate, a retail fuel planning SaaS, in **React** using **Leaflet** maps. When I joined the team, the project was going to be built in __Angular 2__.  But the performance wasn't where we needed it to be. A recent side project was a  __React Native__ app built for internal users to survey sites across the globe.

### [ConsumerAffairs](https://consumeraffairs.com/) - Tulsa, OK
#### Software Engineer - Team Lead
_May 2016 - February 2017_

* Led full-stack development team of 8
* Learned and practiced __SCRUM/Agile__ methodologies
* Laser focus on performance and SEO

ConsumerAffair's site had a Python Django backend using __Jinja2__ templates for markup. While I worked on some light python, my development contributions were mostly focused on frontend __JS/CSS__. I worked with __Sass__ and legacy Stylus, __vanilla JS__ compiled with __gulp__ using __Webpack__ and got my first exposure to __ES6__. I used __jasmine__ in __karma__ unit-tests and __Istanbul__ for coverage. Every Pull Request ran through __Circle CI__ with strict test coverage requirements.

### [Gitwit](http://gitwit.com/) - Tulsa, OK
#### Front-end Developer
_January 2016 - May 2016_

* Built responsive interactive content modules for high traffic clients
* Prototyped client web-apps
* Brought on and managed developers on overflow projects

The environment here changed between clients. For my development vanilla __JS/CSS/HTML__ content was the most common, with one __AngularJS__ app. And tons of modifications to __Wordpress__ and __Squarespace__ themes peppered in here and there (I was their first fulltime developer).

* Collaborated with multiple sprint teams on flagship __AngularJS__ project
* Learned __TDD__
* Maintained mobile app with __Cordova__ for both iOS and Android

I worked mainly on the map module in __AngularJS__ frontend. The app was built with __Grunt__ in combination with __Sass__ and __jQuery__. I wrote unit-tests with __Jasmine__ and __Karma__ and end-to-end tests with __Protractor__ and __PhantomJS__.

### [iMirus](http://imirus.com/) - Tulsa, OK
#### Senior Software Developer
_January 2011 - December 2014_

* Built and maintained __AngularJS__ document reader app
* Native __iOS__ and __Android__ development
* Recruited new developers at university career fairs

For the JS document reader, I used __PouchDB__ and __Lunr.js__ for storage and quick searching. I built and deployed web content with __jQuery__ for clients, as well as __AS3 flash__ animations that were used in the legacy __Adobe Flex__ web app document reader. Before we switched to Angular, I worked in __Objective-C__ for native iPad app development and __Java__ for __Android__ development.
