I love creating web apps. Javascript is my jam. I _love_ learning and with JS, it never ends. I want to keep growing to become ever sharper and even more helpful without losing my kind charming demeanor that helps me to reassure my team I'm here to help. Overall, I want to have fun creating life-changing products and relationships.



### [Kalibrate](http://www.kalibrate.com/) - Tulsa, OK
#### Senior UX Developer
_February 2017 - Present_

* Drew up wireframes and low-to-mid fidelity mockups
* Developed frontend SaaS apps
* Debugged memory and performance issues

I started the role working in __Angular 2__. Before we got too far, we ditched Angular and decided to switch to __React__. From there we added a __WebGL__-enhanced module to take the performance to a new high. A recent sideshow was a mobile surveyor app built with __React Native__ for internal users to survey sites across the globe.

* Led full-stack development team of 8
* Learned and practiced __SCRUM/Agile__ methodologies
* Laser focus on performance and SEO

CA's site had a Python Django backend using __Jinja2__ templates for markup. While I worked on some light python, my development contributions were mostly focused on frontend __JS/CSS__. I worked with __Sass__ and legacy Stylus, __vanilla JS__ compiled with __gulp__ using __Webpack__ and __ES6__ transpilation. We used __jasmine__ in __karma__ unit-tests and __Istanbul__ for coverage. Every Pull Request ran through __Circle CI__ with strict test coverage requirements.

#### Front-end Developer
_January 2016 - May 2016_

* Built responsive interactive content modules for high traffic clients
* Prototyped client web-apps
* Contracted and managed developers on overflow projects

The environment here changed between clients. For my development vanilla __JS/CSS/HTML__ content was the most common, with one __AngularJS__ app. And tons of modifications to __Wordpress__ and __Squarespace__ themes peppered in here and there (I was their first fulltime developer).

Before we switched to Angular, I worked in __Objective-C__ for native iPad app development and __Java__ for __Android__ development.
