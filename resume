Product developer with experience across browsers, OSes, devices, and architectural layers. Specializing in frontend development with React & Redux using RESTful APIs. Recognized for being a clear and effective communicator and mediating software disciplines and stakeholder concerns. Having a love of learning by doing has led me to the career I love today and the greatest part is I always have new opportunities to learn both from new projects and the people I work with.
