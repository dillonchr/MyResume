Product developer with experience across browsers, OSes, devices, and
architectural layers. Specializing in frontend development with React
& Redux using RESTful APIs. Recognized for being a clear and effective
communicator and mediating software disciplines and stakeholder

to learn both from new projects and the people I work with.
