# My Resume
I often had a hard time keeping my resume up-to-date. I would work on it on a specific computer then
get a new computer or otherwise forget where on the PC I had my working resume. Dropbox and Drive
helped out a little. But then I realized how much I liked the aesthetic of the README in Github. And
I figured it's the perfect spot for someone who uses GH daily to host their living resume. Plus now
I get to roll back the clock to see what I used to be proud of. It's a win-win.
