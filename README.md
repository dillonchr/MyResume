##Objective
My objective is to find a position that keeps challenging my skill set in software development. I want to continue to learn more about new technologies with a focus to benefit the bottom line.

##Bio
With nine years of experience in the technology sector, I enjoy every minute spent in development. I am self-taught in all the skills I have accumulated over the years. I started off in web development and got hooked to development. At first, I just did little favors for friends and family. Later I learned dynamic languages and started to do freelance work. Most of my career has been in retail, until I got my current job in 2011.

##What sets me apart from the crowd
* My passion for learning. I absorb new things quickly and independently. I am able to figure out
how things work and communicate it to others.
* Communication skills when working with a team. I'm very easy-going and handle feedback well.
* I can get into the end-user mindset to design and develop a great UI.
* I do have an iPhone, but I'm not a fanboy. I try to stay open-minded when it comes to mobile devices.
