# My Resume
This repo is a poorly-cased-named collection of my living Resume. I didn't use accents there because I assumed context would give it away. Also I didn't want to google the e. Although with the time I spent to type this I remembered that it's `alt+e+e`. So résumé. There.

Anyway, here's a few different formats of my resume. This was a fun alternative to updating a google doc over and over. And it gives me more flexibility with formats. Although at the moment I manually update each one. With a slight exception for the `.bash` one because I can just `resume/resume.sh > resume/resume.bash` that. And running a single command to generate totally counts as automated.
