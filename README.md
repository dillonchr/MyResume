My name is Dillon. I have been fascinated with code since I first learned __HTML__ in 2005.
Since then I've mastered __HTML__, __CSS__ and __JavaScript__. I still love to learn new things in all three languages.

I started working with dynamic pages. Starting off rough with __ASP__ then jumping into __PHP__. I fell in love with
PHP right away. Which means I also loved __MySQL__. This gave me a strong grasp of __SQL__ and managing relational
databases. I learned __WordPress__ to get some freelance work making themes. After learning OOP in PHP, I thought I 
would like to learn more about programming.
I dove into __C#__ and __WinForms__. And I enjoyed enjoyed it so much, I wanted more. I learned __Objective-C__
specifically with the goal of iOS development. After that I learned __Android__ development in __Java__. 
Then realizing native apps are going to the browser, I learned __GWT__. Currently, I've been learning __Node.js__,
__CoffeeScript__, and __AngularJS__ in my free time.

Here's what sets me apart from the crowd:
* Passion for learning. I pick up new things quickly. I am able to figure out
how things work.
* Communication skills when working with a team of any size. I'm very easy-going and can
handle criticism well. 
* I can get into the end-user mindset to design and develop a great UI.
* I have an iPhone, but I'm not a fanboy
