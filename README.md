# Purpose
I wanted to solve a couple of problems I had. Keeping an up-to-date resume in a central spot was hard for me. I would go through emails and find the best version and create a new doc and paste what I had before. So by switching to a Markdown based resume it's easy to see online and paste whereever I need. It's always available and easy to update.
